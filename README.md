**PixelPeek** is a lightweight and easy-to-use Chrome extension designed to display the pixel dimensions of media elements (images, videos, etc.) on any webpage, simply by hovering over them. Whether you're a web developer, designer, or just curious about the size of media content, PixelPeek offers an intuitive way to get accurate measurements instantly.

- Displays pixel dimensions (width and height) for images, videos, iframes, canvas elements, and other media on hover.
- Handles dynamic content by continuously observing newly added elements.
- Works across all websites, providing instant feedback without page reloads.
